/// <summary>
/// Exemple of component to bend a mesh along a spline. This component can be used as-is but will most likely be a base for your own component.
/// 
/// In this basic exemple, you only specify rotation and scale to adapt to the provided mesh.
/// Scale is useful because most of the time, the modeling tools don't use the scaling you want.
/// Rotation is often mandatory because MeshBender will always bend along the X axis and your mesh may be oriented differently.
/// 
/// One children GameObject is created for each spline curve here, with a MeshBender and a MeshFilter on each. The list of GameObject is stored for later cleanup.
/// Each time the spline nodes are changed (a node is added or removed), the stored object are cleaned and the entire process is redone.
/// 
/// The MeshBender listen the curve to detect itself if the nodes it is connected to are moved or rotated. You don't have to manage that yourself here.
/// </summary>
